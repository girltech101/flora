These are examples of driving the NeoPixel ring with an Adafruit FLORA.
The order to review them is:

rgb: flash the first pixel through red, green and blue
all: flash all the pixels
pulse: ramp the intensity up
pulse2: ramp the intensity up and down
chase: chase a single pixel around
chase2: chase a pixel around with hand written trails
fade: chase a pixel around with a frame-buffer based decay
scanner: Like Knight Rider
blend: Multiple sprites and color blending
sparkle: Because it sparkles
